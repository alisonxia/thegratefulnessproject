            <h1>The Gratefulness Project.</h1>
    <p class="about">in a fast-paced world riddled with consumerism, it's easy to forget what's important to you.The Gratefulness Project was created to encourage human reflection. <br><br> gratefulness has been scientifically proven by positive psychology research to lead to greater overall happiness - when people give or receive gratitude, there are spikes in the levels of dopamine and serotonin in their brains. as Sonja Lyubomirsky writes in her book The How of Happiness: A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want, “Gratitude is an antidote to negative emotions, a neutralizer of envy, hostility, worry, and irritation. It is savoring; it is not taking things for granted; it is present-oriented.” people who practice gratefulness tend to feel happier and build stronger relationships. 
<br><br>
here are some starting points to build off of when thinking about gratefulness:<br>
- people: family, friends, peers, coworkers, mentors<br>
- passions: hobbies, causes, interests<br>
- basic needs: safety, food, shelter, health, <br>
- opportunities: education, support systems, resources <br></p>
